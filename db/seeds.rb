    full_meaning: 'Something new is starting for the Subject which could be a new relationship, job or home.   This is likely to be an exciting time for them with lots of hope and anticipation for the future.  The Subject is so caught up in the buzz of it all that they may not be thinking as clearly as they should.
        The Subject should be receptive to change and doing things they wouldnâ€™t normally.  In doing so they will learn about different sides of themself and even discover new things they want out of life.   The Subject will be feeling happy, confident and ready to face what is ahead of them.', 
    upright_meaning: 'The Fool card is numbered 0, which is considered to be a number of infinite potential. Consider him a blank slate, for The Fool has yet to develop a clear personality. He is the symbol of innocence - his journey to come will shape his character yet.
        To see the The Fool generally means a beginning of a new journey, one where you will be filled with optimism and freedom from the usual constraints in life. When we meet him, he approaches each day as an adventure, in an almost childish way. He believes that anything can happen in life and there are many opportunities that are lying out there, in the world, waiting to be explored and developed. He leads a simple life, having no worries, and does not seem troubled by the fact that he cannot tell what he will encounter ahead.',
    reversed_meaning: 'When you land on the reversed Fool in your reading, you can generally find his more negative characteristics being on display. It can mean that you are literally acting like a fool by disregarding the repercussions of your actions. Like the youth depicted in the card, you dont see how dangerous of a position you find yourself in. 
        A reversed Fool card can show that you are living in the moment and not planning for the future. The reversed Fool meaning serves as caution that you should be more aware so as not to be taken advantage of. Like the dog in the Rider Waite version, this card is here to alert you on anything that may sound too good to be true.',
